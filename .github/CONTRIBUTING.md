Thank you for your interest in this project!

# Contributing

Pull requests are welcomed from everyone. This project is still in
very early stages, so we haven't picked a 'correct' coding style.
Feel free to discuss this in the
[discussions](https://github.com/marea-project/viaduct/discussions)
tab.

## Instructions

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:(your username)/viaduct.git

Make your change. Ideally, add tests for your change, although this isn't 100% necessary right
now, while we still decide what direction this software will take.

Tests can be run with Django:

    python manage.py test

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

[pr]: https://github.com/marea-project/viaduct/compare/

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three days (ideally sooner). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request will be accepted:

* The request fixes an open issue
* The request addresses a feature previously mentioned in a discussion
* You have written a good (that is, detailed and well explained) commit message.
