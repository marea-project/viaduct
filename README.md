# Viaduct

A bridge across [Arches](https://github.com/archesproject/arches)

## Purpose

[Our group](https://github.com/achp-project) is involved in the
maintenance of several independent self-hosted instances of the
[Arches](https://github.com/archesproject/arches) Cultural Heritage
platform. The data contained within these instances all comply to
project-specific vocabularies, making the creation of a single
Arches instance for all the data a hard problem. Viaduct seeks to
bypass the problem altogether by acting as a standalone portal for
multiple Arches instances, allowing a user to perform complex
searches on several instances at once, and return unified results
using linked data methodology.
